  <h2>Google Cloud Platform Innovator</h2>

  <p class="container">
    
    As a former president of my dormitory's programming board committee, I have the skills necessary to 
    bring students and technology/services together to increase engagement and awareness with Google's Cloud 
    Platform and services. My numerous leadership experiences has equipped me with the tools necessary to 
    reach out and connect with people in the right places to better serve my fellow students here at UofM.
    I can work alongside the teams that work on Google SQL and other database products to see how they can 
    be adapted to be specifically used by the University of Michigan's tool suite.
